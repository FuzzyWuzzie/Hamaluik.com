Hello, my name is Kenton Hamaluik! I program mostly as a hobby, though more and more for work as well. Sometimes I write about things too.

My main hobbyist interests lie in how games are created. As such, I have a great number of code repositories exploring different aspects of the entire game-creation pipeline and technologies, though almost nothing is complete as a shippable project (many are likely in currently broken states as well). Although it doesn't make sense from a getting-things-done standpoint, I really enjoy figuring out how things work, largely by trying to re-create them from scratch myself. For example, in the game creation world, this means creating my own game engine [largely] from scratch, creating my own asset file formats (including exporters and importers), writing my own shaders, as well as the entire rendering pipeline. I'm a big fan of strict, idealistic entity-component-systems, and have built a couple flavours of my own to varying degrees of success.

Aside from game creation, I also have a propensity for creating apps for my [and my family's] own personal use. These projects include things like: a Christmas gift-giving wishlist website, a webapp for managing storyboards online, and a webapp for keeping track of spells in DnD (among others).

I occasionally tinker in hardware, though tend towards software due to the cost of breaking hardware and storing all the miscellaneous components you tend to collect.

I have a BSc in Biomechanical Engineering from the [University of Alberta](https://ualberta.ca), as well as an MSc in Mechanical Engineering (also from the UofA). You can view the results from my thesis here:

I'm happy to hear from people about the projects that I post, unfortunately I often don't have the time / energy / willpower to maintain, fix, or do things for you. Please don't be upset if I rebuff you!
