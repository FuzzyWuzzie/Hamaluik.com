## Ingredients

| Item | Quantity |
|-|-|
| Flour | 2 cups |
| Baking powder | 4 teaspoons |
| Salt | 1 teaspoon |
| Milk | 1 cup |

## Instructions

1. Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt
2. Add the milk and mix to combine into a sticky dough
3. Once the boiling stew or soup is nearly done, drop spoonfuls of the batter on top. Be sure that there is plenty of liquid in the pot, but try to keep the dumplings on top of the vegetables and meat.
4. Cover and cook for about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the dumplings. Do not remove the lid until it is time to check the dumplings; when ready, a toothpick inserted into one of the dumplings should come out clean.
