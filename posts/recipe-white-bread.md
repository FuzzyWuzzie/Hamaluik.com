## Ingredients

| Item | Quantity |
|-|-|
| Active dry yeast | 1 package / ¼ oz / 7 g |
| Warm Water | 2¼ cups (110–115℉ / 43–46℃) |
| Sugar | ½ teaspoon |
| Canola oil | 2 tablespoons |
| Sugar | 3 tablespoons |
| Salt | 1 tablespoon |
| Bread flour | 6¼–6¾ cups |

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and ½ teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until bubbles form on surface.
2. Whisk together remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, salt and 3 cups flour.
3. Stir oil into yeast mixture; pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth.
4. Stir in enough remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, to form a soft dough. 
5. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 8–10 minutes.
6. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1½ to 2 hours.
7. Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough in half. Shape each into a loaf. Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf pans.
8. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1½ hours.
9. Bake at 375℉ until golden brown and bread sounds hollow when tapped or has reached an internal temperature of 200℉, 30-35 minutes.
10. Remove from pans to wire racks to cool.
