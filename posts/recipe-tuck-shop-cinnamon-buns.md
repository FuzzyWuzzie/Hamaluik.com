## Notes

* An electric mixer is needed for this recipe as it requires a lot of beating
* If the dough is too soft to handle, add a bit more flour. However, the less flour used the better the buns will be

## Instructions

1. Soften yeast in ½ cup warm water with 2 tablespoons sugar. Let the mixture sit until the yeast is dissolved (about 10 minutes).
2. In a large bowl combine 2 cups boiling water, 3 tablespoons margarine, 2 teaspoons salt, and 3 tablespoons sugar, let the margarine melt and the mixture cool a bit.
3. Add 2 cups all-purpose flour and beat hard until very smooth and creamy (about 5 minutes)
4. Add softened yeast mixture, 3 eggs, and 3¼ cups more flour.
5. Continue beating until dough is very smooth (it should be a very soft dough).
6. Cover and let stand in a warm place to rise until the dough is doubled in bulk (about 1 hour)
7. While the dough is rising, in a flat pan melt ⅓ cup margarine, then set aside to cool.
8. In a flat dish, mix 1 cup white sugar and 1½ teaspoons cinnamon.
9. Turn the raised dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Let the dough set 5 to 10 minutes to "firm up".
10. Cut the dough into pieces about the size of a orange.
11. Dip each piece of dough first into the melted margarine, the coat it well in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.
12. Stretch the dough piece until it is 4 to 5 inches long and form it into a simple knot.
13. Place the knots side by side in a 9"x12"x2" pan (be sure the pan is 2" deep and allow a 3" square for each bun)
14. Let the finished buns rise for about 45 minutes.
15. Bake at 375 °F for 30 minutes. Should make 18 good-sized buns.
