## Ingredients

| Item | Quantity |
|:-|:-|
| Flour | 4 cups |
| Baking Powder | 1 teaspoon |
| Baking Soda | ¼ teaspoon |
| Water | 450 mL |
| Shortening | ¼ cup |
| Vegetable Oil | ¼ cup |
| Sesame Oil* | 1 teaspoon |
| Salt | to taste (recipe calls for 2 tsp) |
| Green Onion | 2--3 bunches |

_* optional_

## Instructions

1. Make the dough
    1. Mix the flour, baking powder, and baking soda together
    2. Pour the water in and mix with your hands until it forms a dough (if it gets too sticky to deal with, add a bit of flour on your hands)
    3. Leave the dough in a mixing bowl and cover with a towel
    4. Let sit under the towel for ~half an hour to an hour, until it feels a bit elastic when you poke it (like poking a cheek)
2. Make the green onion mixture
    1. Chop the green onions into little bits (~half a centimetre or so)
    2. Mix the chopped green onions, shortening, vegetable oil, sesame oil, and salt together in a bowl
        * Mixing by hand is the easiest, but shortening is hellishly difficult to wash off your hands so `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
3. Form the green onion cakes
    1. Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about the size (or at least aspect ratio) of a stovetop
    2. Spread the green onion mixture to cover the rolled out dough
    3. Tightly roll the dough up, like you would a cinnamon bun until it is a long cylinder
    4. Chop the cylinder across its length into 8 equal rolls
    5. Twist and squish each of the rolls along the axis into flat pancakes, about 6 inches in diameter
    6. If freezing for later, separate with sheets of parchment paper
4. Cook the green onion cakes
    1. Heat a small pan with a tablespoon or two of your oil of choice on medium-low heat
    2. Fry the green onion cakes, don't flip until the bottom is golden-brown
    3. Serve with sriracha and/or chili paste, hot
